Hi, 
I'm Chaitanya, a Microsoft MVP and full-time web developer for over 10 years; 
and in this web app, I have developed simple cakes store using AspNet MVC Core Razor Pages. 

Below are the high level items covered in this simple application:
1. Dynamically rendered page up and running.
2. Maintainability by applying concepts such as layouts, 
dependency injection, and putting application logic into classes to help keep it out of your markup.
3. Create simple HTML forms and process the data that users send back.
4. Lock down sections of your application so that unauthenticated users can't access them and a quick and simple way for you to log in yourself.
